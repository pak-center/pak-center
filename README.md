Here you will find projects related to IBM mainframe technologies in the areas of z/VM (CP *MONITOR, CMS, MONDCSS, TPC/IP stack, REXX), z/Linux (Rust, C, /dev/monreader, /dev/monwriter), z/OS (COBOL, BAL, REXX, JCL).

The latest are COBOL projects for z/OS and fresh zEM project (formerly known as zpmd) at the docs stage.

Migrated the legacy and substandard zpmd & zmpc code from the diploma thesis (IBM System z Academic Initiative) from **SourceForge.net** to Github. In the near future it will be archived and rewritten from C to Rust as the **zEM** project & Java-Swing to Android Java.

- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking forward to collaborate on z/OS SMF records.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help in accessing the latest version of z/OS & z/VM with compiler PTFs.

##### TODO
* Find my PGMs written in languages: Assembler - BAL, REXX, COBOL, JCL and upload as project.
* Rewrite from scratch z/VM MONITOR projects from MySQL database, C, Java Swing code to PostgreSQL database, Rust, Android Java.
