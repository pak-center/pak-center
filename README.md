### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-->
Here you will find projects related to IBM mainframe technologies from the areas of z/VM (CP MONITOR, CMS, DCSS, TPC/IP Stack, REXX), z/Linux (Rust, C, MySQL, /dev/monreader, /dev/monwriter), z/OS (COBOL, BAL, REXX, JCL).

The most recent are COBOL projects for z/OS.

SourceForge.net migrated legacy and substandard code of zpmd & zmpc from the diploma thesis (IBM System z Academic Initiative). In the near future it will be archived and rewritten from C to Rust & Java-Swing to Android Java.

**TODO**
- Find my small PGMs written in languages: Assembler - BAL, REXX, COBOL, JCL and upload as project.
- Rewrite from scratch z/VM MONITOR projects from MySQL database, C, Java Swing code to PostgreSQL database, Rust, Android Java.

- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking forward to collaborate on z/OS SMF records.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with access to the newest version of z/OS & z/VM with compilers PTFs.
